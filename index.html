              I am a passionate and driven Junior Web Developer with a strong
              foundation in full-stack web development. I hold a Bachelor degree
              in Mechanical Engineering from Joseph Sarwuan Takar University
              Makurdi. I also attended Honey Treat Trade Academy where I gained
              hands-on experience in designing, coding, and maintaining
              websites. My academic journey equipped me with a solid
              understanding of front-end and back-end development, including
              proficiency in languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
              frameworks such as React, and Next.js, and back-end tools like
              Node.js, database like MySQL During my education, I worked on
              various projects, such as [briefly describe a notable project or
              two], which helped me develop practical problem-solving skills and
              an eye for detail. I also completed [internship, certification, or
              relevant experience, if applicable], allowing me to apply my
              skills in a real-world setting and collaborate effectively within
              a development team. I am enthusiastic about creating
              user-friendly, responsive websites and continuously learning
              emerging technologies to enhance my skill set. As a Junior Web
              Developer, I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and
              grow alongside a dynamic team.
